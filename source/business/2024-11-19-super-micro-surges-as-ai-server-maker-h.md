Shares of Super Micro Computer soared nearly 30% in premarket trading on Tuesday, after the server maker sought an extension from Nasdaq for its delayed financial filings and appointed a new auditor as it looks to avoid being delisted.

"BDO's arrival comes just in the nick of time to satisfy the Nasdaq's 60-day deadline to file a compliance plan but even if that plan is accepted the real test will be when those delinquent accounts (quarterly and annual reports) finally see the light of day," said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell.
