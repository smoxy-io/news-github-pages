Synovus Trust senior portfolio manager Daniel Morgan joins Catalysts to preview Nvidia's (NVDA) third quarter earnings expected out after Wednesday's market close. "I think the big number coming into this is going to be guidance going into the fourth quarter," Morgan emphasizes, highlighting the Street's expectations of $37 billion, with unofficial forecasts — or the "whisper numbers" he references — reaching $39 billion. "If they don't beat that, we might see a sell-off," he warns. Regarding a spreading out of demand that investors expect, Morgan notes the concentrated growth in generative AI is due to the need for data center technologies. "To be honest with you guys, we all know that the real growth in terms of generative AI has been in data center\[s\]," he states, adding that hyperscalers will likely continue to over-invest in this area of development.
