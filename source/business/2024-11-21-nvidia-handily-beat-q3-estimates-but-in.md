Nvidia (NVDA) handily topped earnings estimates for the third quarter with revenue up 94% year-over-year, but the stock dipped over the chip giant's fourth quarter forecasts. Moor Insights & Strategy Founder, CEO, and Chief Analyst Patrick Moorhead reacts to Wednesday's results and the subsequent stock response. "It was a win," Moorheadays s. "But the challenge with this and the opportunity is investors want more." Questions about Nvidia's Blackwell chips are also in focus on the earnings call with CEO Jensen Huang saying that Blackwell is in "full production." "I have confidence that for the next 18 months, the likes of Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT), and the tier-two cloud service providers will continue to gobble these up," Moorehead says about Nvidia's landmark chips. "The primary reason is the fear of missing out." Moorhead goes on to describe what investors should be watching for in the coming quarters when it comes to Nvidia, expanding upon whether the massive growth story can continue and what the next catalyst could be.
