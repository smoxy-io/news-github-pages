Bosch, the world's biggest car parts supplier, said it is planning to cut 3,500 jobs by end-2027 in its cross-domain computer solutions division, half of which will be at German sites, flagging weak demand in intelligent driver assistance systems and solutions for automated driving. It also plans to cut around 750 jobs by 2032 at its Hildesheim plant, in Germany, 600 of which are planned by the end of 2026.
