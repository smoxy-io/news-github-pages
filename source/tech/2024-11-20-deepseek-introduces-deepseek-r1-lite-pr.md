Artificial intelligence (AI) models have made substantial progress over the last few years, but they continue to face critical challenges, particularly in reasoning tasks. Large language models are proficient at generating coherent text, but when it comes to complex reasoning or problem-solving, they often fall short. This inadequacy is particularly evident in areas requiring structured, step-by-step logic, such as mathematical reasoning or code-breaking. Despite their impressive generative capabilities, models tend to lack transparency in their thought processes, which limits their reliability. Users are often left guessing how a conclusion was reached, leading to a trust gap between AI outputs and
