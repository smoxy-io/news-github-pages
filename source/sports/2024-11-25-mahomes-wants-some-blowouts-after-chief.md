Patrick Mahomes is tired of his Kansas City Chiefs' games coming down to the final seconds."You want to have some blowouts," the quarterback told reporters, including ESPN's Adam Teicher, after the Chiefs' 30-27 victory over the Carolina Panthers. "I would love to win a game (before) the very last play."The Chiefs were up 27-19 with two minutes remaining, but Panthers running back Chuba Hubbard scored a 1-yard touchdown to bring his team back into the contest. Carolina then completed a two-point conversion to tie the game.Mahomes set up a Kansas City field goal as he scrambled for 33 yards with 38 seconds remaining, and kicker Spencer Shrader made the 31-yard attempt for the walk-off victory. The Chiefs have won eight of their 11 matchups by one score. Four of those victories came down to the final play, which ties an NFL record for the most by any team through 11 contests."You want be a little calmer in the fourth quarter," Mahomes said. "I've always said it can be a good thing as you get to the playoffs and later in the season, just knowing that you've been in those moments before and knowing how to kind of attack it."Mahomes was 27-for-37 against the Panthers, passing for 269 yards and three touchdowns. Kansas City currently sits atop the AFC with a 10-1 record, but Mahomes is having one of his worst statistical seasons as a pro: The 29-year-old has the highest interception rate and lowest touchdown rate of his six-year career, at 2.3% and 4.5%, respectively.The Chiefs play their division rivals, the Las Vegas Raiders, on Friday at 3 p.m. ET.
